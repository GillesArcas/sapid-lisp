# sapid-lisp
Lot of interesting and sapid parentheses

sapid lisp is a lisp interpretor with the following features:

    dynamic binding
    different name spaces for symbol values and functions
    tail recursion and mutual recursion optimization
    currently two implementations: one in python, a second one in sapid lisp itself. Both implementations share the same lisp modules and testing environment.
    most functions are written in lisp
    limited environment: trace, pretty print, help, testing

No more reasons to choose those features than the fact I studied to write a lisp interpretor this way.

The most interesting features is perhaps the way tail recursion optimization is coded with exceptions. This makes natural and easy to transform a non tail recursion optimized interpretor into an optimized one.
